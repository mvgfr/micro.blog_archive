         	<p>The central problem, is the enormous <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">jenga tower</a> that we&rsquo;ve built:
- Full of dependencies that virtually <em>no one</em> understands.
- Dependencies generally chosen, for expedience.
- Chosen by coders at all level of in/experience.
- Driven by &ldquo;ship it now&rdquo;, and &ldquo;move fast and break things&rdquo;.
- With management <em>rarely</em> caring about risks - until one becomes a <em>public</em> crisis, which can no longer be ignored.</p>

<p>Prediction 1: These crises will get both worse, and more frequent - bad actors (of all stripes; not only in tech), have noticed how vulnerable <em>everything</em> is.</p>

<p>Prediction 2: Even still, there will be little fundamental change in how we write &amp; deploy code - because most of the people making these decisions haven&rsquo;t felt it. Yet.</p>

<p>Prediction 3: The &ldquo;powers that be&rdquo; think they&rsquo;re insulated from the pain. It may not be long til they find out how wrong they are.</p>
