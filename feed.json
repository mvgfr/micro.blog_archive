				"title": "Apparently it's time for M1 users, to migrate their Homebrew config. Like right now.",
				"content_html": "<p>Drat; that was an unpleasant surprise:</p>\n<p>For some reason, when I tried <code>brew upgrade</code> today, the response was: <code>Cannot install in Homebrew on ARM processor in Intel default prefix</code>.</p>\n<p>Weird; it&rsquo;s been working fine, via Terminal in Rosetta, on my M1, for quite some time. Last I saw, that was required, on Apple Silicon.</p>\n<p>I don&rsquo;t see any warning logged from past &ldquo;brew update&rdquo; runs. And I couldn&rsquo;t find any announcement or release note, that Homebrew is now ready for prime-time on M1 - but apparently someone felt it necessary to force the issue. :/</p>\n<p>So, since I depend on brew and several tools installed that way - <em>including some automation</em> - I dropped what I was supposed to be doing, to sort this out. Here&rsquo;s what it took for me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Run <code>brew bundle dump</code> - this will create a <code>Brewfile</code> in the current directory.</li>\n<li>May or may not be necessary: Quit &amp; relaunch Terminal, <em>without Rosetta</em>.</li>\n<li>Install Homebrew - let it go to the new dir, <code>/opt/homebrew/</code> - AKA <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code>.</li>\n<li>Run <code>brew dump</code> - which uses the previously-created <code>Brewfile</code>, to (hopefully) install what you were using (as much as it can) in it&rsquo;s new structure, in <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code>.</li>\n<li>As long as this succeeded, delete / archive the <code>Brewfile</code>. If not, debug…</li>\n<li>If you haven&rsquo;t personalized <code>$PATH</code> etc.: Follow the directions (in the output above) for updating that.</li>\n<li>If you <em>have</em> (personalized <code>$PATH</code> etc.): Update that to also include <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code> (using the ouput as a guide) - note that there are some <em>new</em> environment vairables here, to consider adding to your shell&rsquo;s config. You&rsquo;ll likely want to make sure the new dir is <em>before</em> the old one (so any tools not yet updated are still accessible - and new tools take precedence over the now stranded ones).</li>\n<li>Update any needed <em>configs</em> that live in <code>/usr/local</code> (ex: for <code>clamav</code>), into the correct place in the new <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code>.</li>\n<li>Now find wherever you might have references to brew tools, which are hard-coded for <code>/usr/local</code>, and update instead, to <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code>. Suggestions of places to look: <code>/etc/crontab</code>, user-specific crontabs (ex: <code>crontab -l</code>), LaunchItems and such. And scripts that might be hard-coded for <code>/usr/local</code>. (Yes; hard-coding is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; - and sometimes useful to, for example, be sure to use the tool installed via brew, vs. a built-in tool by the same name.)</li>\n<li>Repeat on any other systems you need to.</li>\n<li>Set a reminder to clean out the stuff in <code>/usr/local</code>, once it&rsquo;s no longer needed. (It <em>might</em> be sufficient to <code>which</code> each tool, and confirm when they&rsquo;re all found in <code>${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}</code> vs. the old <code>/usr/local</code>.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Whew! That seemed a bit more difficult than necessary - especially since it was (as far as I could tell) forced without warning.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Drat; that was an unpleasant surprise:\r\n\r\nFor some reason, when I tried `brew upgrade` today, the response was: `Cannot install in Homebrew on ARM processor in Intel default prefix`.\r\n\r\nWeird; it's been working fine, via Terminal in Rosetta, on my M1, for quite some time. Last I saw, that was required, on Apple Silicon.\r\n\r\nI don't see any warning logged from past \"brew update\" runs. And I couldn't find any announcement or release note, that Homebrew is now ready for prime-time on M1 - but apparently someone felt it necessary to force the issue. :/\r\n\r\nSo, since I depend on brew and several tools installed that way - _including some automation_ - I dropped what I was supposed to be doing, to sort this out. Here's what it took for me:\r\n\r\n1. Run `brew bundle dump` - this will create a `Brewfile` in the current directory.\r\n2. May or may not be necessary: Quit & relaunch Terminal, _without Rosetta_.\r\n3. Install Homebrew - let it go to the new dir, `/opt/homebrew/` - AKA `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}`.\r\n4. Run `brew dump` - which uses the previously-created `Brewfile`, to (hopefully) install what you were using (as much as it can) in it's new structure, in `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}`.\r\n5. As long as this succeeded, delete / archive the `Brewfile`. If not, debug…\r\n6. If you haven't personalized `$PATH` etc.: Follow the directions (in the output above) for updating that.\r\n7. If you _have_ (personalized `$PATH` etc.): Update that to also include `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}` (using the ouput as a guide) - note that there are some _new_ environment vairables here, to consider adding to your shell's config. You'll likely want to make sure the new dir is _before_ the old one (so any tools not yet updated are still accessible - and new tools take precedence over the now stranded ones).\r\n8. Update any needed _configs_ that live in `/usr/local` (ex: for `clamav`), into the correct place in the new `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}`.\r\n9. Now find wherever you might have references to brew tools, which are hard-coded for `/usr/local`, and update instead, to `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}`. Suggestions of places to look: `/etc/crontab`, user-specific crontabs (ex: `crontab -l`), LaunchItems and such. And scripts that might be hard-coded for `/usr/local`. (Yes; hard-coding is \"bad\" - and sometimes useful to, for example, be sure to use the tool installed via brew, vs. a built-in tool by the same name.)\r\n10. Repeat on any other systems you need to.\r\n11. Set a reminder to clean out the stuff in `/usr/local`, once it's no longer needed. (It _might_ be sufficient to `which` each tool, and confirm when they're all found in `${HOMEBREW_PREFIX}` vs. the old `/usr/local`.)\r\n\r\nWhew! That seemed a bit more difficult than necessary - especially since it was (as far as I could tell) forced without warning.\n",

A (bash) script to list the Titles of your Notes:\n    - The code is in separate section below.\n    - Save the script to `~/dump-note-titles.sh`.\n    - [`chmod`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod) it, to be executable:\n        ```\n        chmod u+x ~/dump-note-titles.sh\n        ```\n    - Run it once, to seed the output file:\n        ```\n\t\t~/dump-note-titles.sh\n        ```\n    - Open the `~/titles-from-notes-app.txt` file which it generated.\n        - It should have a list of the Titles of your Notes.\n1. Keep this _up-to-date_, via [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron):\n\t- Edit your crontab:\n\t\t```\n\t\tcrontab -e\n\t\t```\n    - Add a line like this:\n        ```\n        48  *  *  *  *\t ~/dump-note-titles.sh\n        ```\n    - Yes; [cron can be a bear to debug](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+debug+a+cron+job&ia=web). :/\n1. Config QuickSilver to use this new \"index\":\n    - Add a Catalog entry, using `File & Folder Scanner`.\n    - For the Path, select the `~/titles-from-notes-app.txt` file generated by the script above.\n    - For the Include Contents setting, select `Text Lines`.\n1. Config a new Quicksilver Action, to open Notes by title:\n    - Open [`Script Editor.app`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/MacAutomationScriptingGuide/GettoKnowScriptEditor.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40016239-CH5-SW1).\n    - Paste the code in - see the separate section below.\n    - Save it, as `open note by title.scpt` (`File format: Script`), to your Quicksilver Actions directory.\n        - Which is usually here: `~/Library/Application Support/Quicksilver/Actions/`.\n\n## How to use\n- Fire up Quicksilver.\n- Start typing some substring of a Note Title.\n- Select the Title you want from the results.\n- Select `open note by title` as the action.\n\n### bash Script `~/dump-note-titles.sh`\n\t#!/bin/bash\n\tosascript \\\n\t\t-e 'set outFilePath to (((path to home folder) as text) & \"titles-from-notes-app.txt\")' \\\n\t\t-e 'tell application \"Notes\"' \\\n\t\t-e     'set nameList to name of every note' \\\n\t\t-e 'end tell' \\\n\t\t-e 'set outFile to open for access file outFilePath with write permission' \\\n\t\t-e 'repeat with theName in nameList' \\\n\t\t-e     'write theName & return to outFile as «class utf8»' \\\n\t\t-e 'end repeat' \\\n\t\t-e 'close access outFile' \\\n\n### Applescript `open note by title.scpt`\n\tusing terms from application \"Quicksilver\"\n\t\ton process text ThisClipping\n\t\t\ttell application \"Notes\"\n\t\t\t\tshow note ThisClipping\n\t\tend process text\n\tend using terms from\n\n(Yes; I do intend to put this in a repo, where it belongs.)\n",
